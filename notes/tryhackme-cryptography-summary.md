# TryHackMe: Introduction to Cryptography â€“ Summary

This room provided a beginner-friendly walkthrough of core cryptographic principles. I learned:

- **Symmetric Encryption**: Same password/key is used for both encryption and decryption.
- **GPG**: Performed symmetric file encryption using `gpg -c` and decryption using `gpg <filename>.gpg`.
- **OpenSSL**: Used `openssl enc` for AES-256-CBC based encryption and decryption.
- **Confidentiality**: Encryption ensures that unauthorized users cannot access sensitive files.

Both methods provided hands-on experience with tools commonly used in the cybersecurity industry. These exercises helped reinforce my understanding of secure data handling.
