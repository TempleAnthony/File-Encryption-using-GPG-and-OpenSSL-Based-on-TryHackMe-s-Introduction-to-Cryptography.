# File Encryption with GPG and OpenSSL

This repository demonstrates symmetric file encryption and decryption using **GNU Privacy Guard (GPG)** and **OpenSSL**, based on practical exercises from the [TryHackMe: Introduction to Cryptography](https://tryhackme.com) learning room.

The aim of this project is to showcase practical skills in protecting sensitive files and understanding the foundation of symmetric key cryptography in cybersecurity.
